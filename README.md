# Network Anomaly Detection

This repository contains tools and datasets for network anomaly detection. The goal is to provide a framework for evaluating different anomaly detection algorithms on various network traffic datasets.

## Datasets

This project aims to include a variety of network datasets for anomaly detection. Currently, the following dataset is supported:

*   **RT-IOT2022**: A real-time IoT dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

In the future, we plan to add support for 4 more datasets.

## Anomaly Detection Models

The following anomaly detection models are currently implemented or planned:

*   **Neural Network Autoencoder**: A deep learning model for unsupervised anomaly detection.
*   **Isolation Forest**: An ensemble-based machine learning algorithm for anomaly detection.

We plan to add one more model in the future.

## Getting Started

(Instructions on how to set up and run the project will be added here.)

## Future Work

*   Add support for 4 more network datasets.
*   Implement one more anomaly detection model.
*   Develop 3 tools for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
